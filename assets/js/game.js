//  *Alerts the player's total stats
//  *Asks the player if they want to play again
//  *If yes, call startGame() to restart the game
//After the player skips or defeats an enemy (and there are still more robots to fight):
//  *Ask the player is they want to "shop"
//  *If no, continue as normal
//  *if yes, call the shop() function
//  *In the shop() function, ask player if they want to "refill" health, "upgrade" attack, or "leave" the shop
//  *If refill, subtract money and increase health
//  *If upgrade, subtract money and increase attack power
//  *If leave, alert goodbye and exit funtion
//  *If any other invalid option, call shop() again
